In this projects, we are interested in the following topics:


- Statistical information about the dataset
- Relationship between Helpfulness and Scores
- Sentimental Analysis
- Network Analysis



## 1. Data analysis


To begin with, we need to explore the dataset, before we can dig into deeeper and more interesting points.

The first thing that come into my mind is that we can produce a list of most popular movies for each year, based on the numbers of reviews. Not only this list can bring us back to our childhoods, when we once again face those familliar names, but also show us the growth of one of the most successful companies over the world.

## 2.  Do extreme score reviews more "Helpful" or "Unhelpful" than other reviews?


After we have an understanding of the characteristics of the dataset, the following three topics attracts our attention: Relationship between Helpfulness and Scores, Sentimental Analysis, and Network Analysis. 

Prof. Tian has told us an inspring example, that people tend to give 5-star scores at their first reviews. Besides this, we wonder, is there any relationship between reviews' helpfulness and scores? Many people believe that one is more likely to watch those extreme reviews, since comments such as "good" or "not bad" are never informative to people. We enjoy reading those reviews that provide deep insights or strong emotions, because they satisfy our curiosities as well as intentions to know more about that product. As a result, we may say the five-star and one-star reviews may receive much more "helful" or "unhelpful" clicks than other reviews.

## 3. Sentiment Analysis


We have talked quite a lot about data characteristics, so it is reasonalble to walk into the field of sentiments. We want to see how people feel about movies on Amazon.

## 4. Network Analysis


Social newworks are everywhere. We not only have social networks in the real world, but also in the virtual one. Sometimes we do not even know there might be a network between ourselves and someone who is living thousands of miles away. In order to quantify the closeness between users, we draw a line between two users if they comment on the same movie. As the dataset is very hugh, we give up the idea of making a graph of all users. But rather, we would produce the graph on the top (x%?) users. (describe the graph and then talk about the findings and meanings.)
